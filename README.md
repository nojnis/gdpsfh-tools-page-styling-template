basically the html and CSS code needs to be put
into index.php file in FTP server which is located
in tools folder. (tip: do <style> copy style.css
contents here and put it in index.php</style>
do that after copying the html page contents
to above the <?PHP...> code. preferably put the 
<style> below html... if u need extra help ask.
also to not make it say my gdps name tools modify
the h1 tag in html to ex <h1>your gdps name</h1>
